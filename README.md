# Tic-Tac-Toe-solver_202401100300005
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid, where players take turns marking 'X' or 'O' in empty squares. The objective is to align three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal. This project aims to develop an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe solver using Python, where the player competes against an AI opponent.
